<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<h4 id="initial-stable-stratis-release">Initial Stable Stratis Release</h4>
<p>Stratis is a Linux local storage management tool that aims to enable easy use of advanced storage features such as thin provisioning, snapshots, and pool-based management and monitoring.</p>
<p>After two years of development, Stratis 1.0 has stabilized its on-disk metadata format and command-line interface, and is ready for more widespread testing and evaluation by potential users. Stratis is implemented as a daemon – <code>stratisd</code> – as well as a command-line configuration tool called <code>stratis</code>, and works with Linux kernel versions 4.14 and up.</p>
<p>Packages will soon be available for Fedora. We also hope that other Linux distributions consider packaging Stratis 1.0 components (although this will require support for Rust 1.25+ and Python 3).</p>
<h2 id="open-issues">Open Issues</h2>
<h4 id="rapid-growth-of-used-storage-in-pool-may-cause-errors">Rapid Growth of Used Storage in Pool May Cause Errors</h4>
<p>Rapid increase in the data stored in the pool, such as creating tens of filesystems in a loop, may cause filesystem creation to fail intermittently. Writing large amounts to filesystems in parallel may also trigger this. (<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1152">issue 1152</a>)</p>
<h4 id="d-bus-api-not-yet-stable">D-Bus API not yet stable</h4>
<p>The Stratis development team has not yet declared Stratis’ D-Bus API as stable. We recommend waiting until it is, to integrate Stratis support into other tools. In the meantime, the <code>stratis</code> command-line tool can be used to configure and monitor Stratis pools. (<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1237">issue 1237</a>)</p>
<h4 id="dm-cache-issue-in-4.18.7-kernels-affects-stratis-cache-tier">dm-cache issue in 4.18.7+ kernels affects Stratis Cache Tier</h4>
<p>An issue with dm-cache that affects Stratis cache tier creation was introduced into the 4.18.7 stable release. Users interested in using a cache tier should avoid this and later kernels in the 4.18 series. This issue will be fixed in 4.19.
